# Project Requirements
From the brief provided in the ReadMe.md file I will make the following assumptions:
* A MongoDB will be required for the hosting of a database
* I will need a collection for users and a collection for questions and answers.
* passport will be required for authenticating users
* Users will be given permissions:
  * **Full** - Read and Write to the questions and answers collection
  * **Lesser** - Read questions and answers
  * **Minimal** - Read the questions only
  
Once the full brief is provided I will review and amend these assumptions
