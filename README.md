# Prepratory Work for the Synoptic Project

> ## Project Overview and Objectives
> You work for WebbiSkools Ltd, a software company that provides on-line educational solutions for education establishments and training providers. Your manager would like you to design, build, and test a database-driven website to manage quizzes, each consisting of a set of multiple-choice questions and their associated answers. The websiteâ€™s capabilities will only be accessible to known users. Users with full permissions will be able to view and edit the questions and answers; users with lesser permissions will be able to view them but not edit them; users with minimal permissions will only be able to see the questions.
>
> You will need to:
>
> 1. Review all the key information and create a design for the quiz manager;
> 2. Construct the quiz manager in accordance with the design;
> 3. Test that the quiz manager meets its requirements;
> 4. Document what you built.
> 
> ## Project Outputs and Deliverables
> Once completed, to demonstrate completion of the task you will be asked to provide a series of outputs that should be submitted together with the synoptic project declaration.
>
> | Deliverable | Output |	Evidence |
> |-------------|--------|-----------|
> | Design | Create simple design documentation to describe what the quiz manager will do and how it will work. This is likely to include: <ul> <li>Any assumptions made about requirements or changes made to the requirements;</li><li>Sketches of the user interface;</li><li>Brief explanations describing what each element of the user interface does;</li><li>Use cases and/or user stories and/or sequence diagrams describing the various interactions that users can have with the system;</li><li>One of more data models representing the data required to represent users and their permissions, quizzes, questions and answers</li></ul> | Word or PDF or similar |
> | Construction | Write a program that implements the quiz manager as a database-driven website.<ul><li>Your program should be logically structured.</li><li>It should follow good design and coding practices.</li><li>The website does not need to be deployed on the internet: accessing it locally is sufficient.</li></ul> | Program code, database schemas, configuration data etc. |
> | Test | Create and execute a set of tests that demonstrate that the program meets its requirements.<ul><li>The tests may be manual or automated.</li><li>The tests may be written before, after, or at the same time as the program code.</li><li>For each test you should document its expected outcome and the actual result.</li></ul> | Any suitable format e.g. textual documents, spreadsheets, program code. |
> |Document	| Document the results of your work.<ul><li>Discuss any limitations of your design and/or implementation.</li><li>Propose future improvements</li><li>Create a user guide</li></ul> | Word or PDF document or similar. A video might be suitable for a user guide. |

> ## Project Information and Equipment
> To complete this project, you will need to review all information in the bullet list below. This can be found in the Appendix, and will enable you to deliver the key outputs and deliverables for this project as detailed in the table above.
> * Background information;
> * Business requirements;
> * Apprentice declaration. In addition, you will be provided with access to a virtual platform or alternatively if a virtual platform is not available, your training provider and or employer will provide you with all resources required to complete your project including:
> * Computer equipment with access to the Internet;
> * An appropriate software development environment;
> * Suitable document preparation software.
>
> ## Apprenticeships Competencies Covered
> | ** Competency Standard ** |
> |---------------------------|
> | Logic: Writes good quality code (logic) with sound syntax in at least one language. |
> | User interface: can develop effective user interfaces for at least one channel. |
> | Data: can effectively link code to the database/data sets. |
> | Test: can test code and analyse results to correct errors found using either V-model manual testing and/or using unit testing. |
> | Design: can create simple data models and software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program, following best practices and standards. |
> | Analysis: can understand and create basic analysis artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories. |
> | Can apply good practice approaches according to the relevant paradigm (for example object oriented, event driven or procedural). |
> | Can apply the maths required to be a software developer (e.g. algorithms, logic and data structures). |
